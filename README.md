# Badge Generator

Utils for quickly making badges for an event from a spreadsheet with info from e.g. Google Forms.

(All example photos are of real people but personal information is fake.)

Edit `Badge_Generator.py` with some config properties (optional) and run.
A pdf of the badges will be made.
